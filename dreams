Tales of James - video games inspired by the James Mythos
Lunatic Eve - Rokugan meets Kamigawa in my imagination

QR-Code Battler
  - The QR-Code determines the category of object you find
  - Your current inventory and level determine the particulars
  - Many codes that you find should be slightly beyond your ability,
    the game should encourage you to return to places you've been
  - Once you've gotten a code, the game should allow you to reuse
    the code with diminishing returns, perhaps as monster battles
    or healing
  - Optionally, you can add QR-Codes you've already seen to a
    QR-Cube, powerful objects that provide a continuous benefit, but
    require the layering of many QR-Codes of the same size.
  - Once you've added a QR-Code to a QR-Cube, you can never benefit
    from that code again
1-Dimensional Shadow Game
  - The game opens with one of a number of interpretations,
    in English.
  - "I'm a girl, and I cast a shadow. But what if I was a
    shadow, then what would I cast?"
  - "Lines that are parallel meet at Infinity!" Euclid repeatedly,
    heatedly, urged. Until he died, and so reached that vicinity: in
    it he found that the damned things diverged.
  - 1D folk are dots, and they are of a variety of skin tones.
    - later when you find another line, the dudes are of a variety
      of tones, but not the traditional skin tones. Some other rainbow
      of skin.
  - A 1D dude meditates and becomes capable of turning
  - The dude perceives a line of the 2D world.
  - The line sweeps under your control, like a radar/sonar
  - The 2D objects you pass over leave brief shadows
  - The music is made using the VI Hart 2D music machine
     - or some procedural music generator
  - The space between the lines is filled with a procedurally
    generated space filling curve.
      - The lines live in 'corridors' between the space filling
        curves.
      - The procedure that is generating these curves should
        be computationally intense, and require the use of the
        GPU. The point being, this game requires 3D acceleration.
      - There should be bumps and ripples where the curve is not
        perfect. In these places there are fields of colourful
        2D objects.
  - Maybe there are 2D beasts composed of many dots that move together
    in a swarm (maybe that would be awesome)
  - You gather dots from your homeline to come with you and explore
     - they follow you around, providing their vision lines as long
       as they are "with you". This represents communication.
  - OK get this:
    - instead of using English for dialog between the dots, we'll use
      some symbols. Maybe brail that scrolls by, or maybe binary
      sequences, or maybe sound-waves (and I kind of like that because
      then these 1D folk are in some way already in touch with the 2D
      world)
    - when there are folk around, you get a dialog bar for each of them
      sized to represent distance. The bars resize as you move about
      relative to the folk until one dominates, or they are all too
      far away.
    - This also lets you know "oh I hear folk? There must be folk nearby"
    - We can also have monsters or whatever phenomena (even some terrain
      features) make noise.
    - The folk are usually silent (maybe represented by all zeros, or a
      line, or whatever silence is in brail) but when two folk are in
      talking distance they chatter (procedurally generated conversation?
      or maybe not, maybe just gibber jabber)
  - Once the folk have been brought to a clearing, you can leave them there
    and they arrange themselves into graphs, or something.

VI Hart 2D music machine
  - I don't know if anyone has made this already, but I must
  - You put dots on a staff(sp), and then reflect and rotate
    and loop or apply filters. etc
Kingdom Animalia
  - Focus on North America
  - Use animals from Native American folk-lore
  - The animals are used for a spiritual grid-control game
    in which players control portions of north-america
  - Many of the same animal contributes to your grid-control
  - Animals have terrain types where they contribute best

Game that continuously re-encrypts itself
 - the more you succeed in the game, the game re-encrypts itself

Arrogant Gamer
  - Make it accessible to the non-sighted folk
  - Embed text adventures in the about page

Dyno
 - In the vast desert of the mind there is an interment camp for psychs
 - Escape from psych camp, cross the desert.

Twine++
 - A graphical story editor that outputs twine, but has:
   - copy/paste of entire rooms or node structures
   - non-grid based story graph
     - eg the current node is fully expanded while the rest float nearby, collapsed
   - cascading mechanism for DRYing up descriptions

I'm Sorry, Pilot
 - A mech game for the XBoxOne that focuses on Kinect based gameplay
 - imagine Gasaraki but you are in your living room giving voice commands.
 - The mech is far too complicated to control directly with a joystick; it
    needs to be controlled with thought or speech, and it needs to learn to
    be one with the pilot.
 - Mech starts appologetic and bad, later it becomes the master
 - questions of control emerge

Social Media Agregator Game
 - You play in a kingdom building things with coins, but the coins come
    from your various social media channels

Dragons' Song
  I bring you the Ocean in my arms.
  And hug you.
  You know the wind is carrying us all the time.
  Love is.
  I'm laughing with you my brother.

  - make a game about this

Prototype
 - A game that is released as a series of working prototypes.
 - Each prototype is only available for a limited time.
 - Each prototype contains information useful for playing the next
 - Eventually, after people have played a bunch of them, announce that
   you've dropped plans to continue development.
 - After a few months, open source the game

Regex Engine (I, Oniguruma)
 - You are a regex engine:
 - You receive a pattern, and then inputs.
 - A millisecond timer is running, and you need to parse input into match data
   quickly and accurately
 - like Papers Please, but for regex
 - too slow and your library falls out of use
 - too inaccurate and you get a rep as buggy

Regex Tower Defense
 - A tower defense game in which you can cheaply buy towers that have specific
   regexes
 - you can upgrade them by making them more general
 - they have a recharge time
 - enemies are phrases that you can decompose with different regexes
 - currency is match data?
 - THEY MUST NOT REACH THE CORE

Leaderboard:
 - a game that agregates various leaderboards and tracks your stats
 - Can you be the best at being the best? How long can you stay the best best
